TensorImage101
This was a test of CIFAR10 dataset, where , following good instructions, i was able to feed
an neuronal network with the clean dataset provided by tensorflow.
Then i made some test in order to know how accurate was my model, how much loss could i been facing
and made some personal test with some personal images.
 
I find this model a good example of classification and it was fun to grab my own photos of a cat and test
if the network was able to guess it.
